# mc-dupe
A dupe bot for frame dupe supported anarchy servers, made using JS.

To start bot you need Node.js installed.
And if you have it installed open a terminal in directory of the bot and run "npm install" and after that run "npm start"

## Note: I didnt added a captcha bypass system cuz i am too lazy for it but its possible check other sources or do yourself.
